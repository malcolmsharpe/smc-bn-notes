# Notes for "Simultaneously maximal coupling of Bayesian networks"

Simultaneously maximal coupling is well-studied for auto-regressive factorizations of joint distributions over finitely many random variables. This project investigates generalizing simultaneously maximal coupling to general factorizations, as expressed by Bayesian networks.

Much of this material previously appeared in sketch form on [my blog](https://masharpe.wordpress.com/).
